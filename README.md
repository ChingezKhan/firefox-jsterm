# Terminal for Firefox

This Firefox addon contains full-featured console that supports
JS, [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) and [LiveScript](http://livescript.net).

Unlike Chrome addons like [CoffeeConsole](https://github.com/snookca/CoffeeConsole),
this one supports DOM interactions which make scripting of pages very fast.
